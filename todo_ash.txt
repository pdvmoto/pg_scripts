1. Query : find query-details from ash:
  - which root_id, list in order of time (last 1hr)
  - longest root_id (min/max)
  - session, app-name if know..

2. RR: find details on a root-req:
    - which app + where + when
    - how long was session..
    - which queries in the rr (in order of sample-time, with duration)
    - sequentially: the ash-recs (how to display per nodes...)

3. relate queries to tab/indx and tab/ind to queries..

todo items:

- reduce sess_log and datb_log: only log when relevant data changes ?
    - so far not using this info much.. can be less?? 
    - try using sess_log to list queries.. ? (sample interval too large...)
- low freq logging: datb: every 30 min... per tsrv_uuid, 
  build check in get_datb : only if previous log was 30min ago..
- every 5 min host, master, tsrver ? 
  build critirium into do_snap or make it a paramter.

- ybx_logg_par : parameter table....
    log_datb_interval
    log_snap_ointerval: univ, host, master, tsrver
    log_sess: depending on activity, changes ? 
    log_ash: no limit.. bcse sometimes need ad-hoc ?  

- views on ... host, mast, tsrv tables to include log_dt from snap.
- host name not always suitable for view, bcse tsrver can move hosts ? 

- host_mst: detect and fill..

- null fields in qury_mst ?? check ! 

- include collection of rr into ashy
- complete collection of get_sess() by using ash to generate sess_mst records.
- find missing query_id in sess_log using text to look up in qury_mst.
- date in rr-qry: the order of the queries matters
- fetch tblt_uuid into ashy_log, to link to table, 
  needs to be done on same node

start with:
 - extract root requests: 
    rr_uuid, start/end, session: sess_id => tsrv +pid+start_dt 
    - disintct rr + min/max.
    - then find session where min-rr is inside sess start/end 
 - extract combis of rr + query (with start_dt + end dt + ... ? )
 - based on qury: list RRs  (in given time-frame, say last hr)
    - duration of RR
    - duration of query(s) in RR
    - activity inside RR
    - activity in side Qry-in-RR
  
questions

q1: how to know for certain that a rr is finished.. 
    (no new ash since last sample..?) 
    (session is over...)

q2: try smaller interval, catch more events? 


issue..

Identify or eliminate "Idle" events in ASH, notably from cron launcher.

Looking for a way to identify "Idle" events in yb_active_session_history. 
Idle, in this case meaning events (ash-records) that do not represent active- or active-waiting- states of a process and thus consume few resources. 
Notably I found a lot of ASH-records coming from the cron-launcher with query_id=7 or query_id=5 (in my case, detected on an otherwise idle system).

In some instances, 80+ percent of the ash_records were query_id=7, coming from the cron-launcher (identified by pid). On an idle system, ash-inspection seems to identify cron as "consuming activity"

This leads me to a more general question: Identify or Eliminate "Idle" event.


Version tested/detected: 
PostgreSQL 15.2-YB-2.25.0.0-b0 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by clang version 17.0.6 (https://github.com/yugabyte/llvm-project.git 9b881774e40024e901fc6f3d313607b071c08631), 64-bit

Some queries I used to detect..


-- query_id 7 is a sizable percentage of ASH, 
-- even on a rather idle system.
select  count(*)  total_ash
, sum ( case query_id when 7 then 1 else 0 end )as  nr_of_sevens
from yb_active_session_history ash ;

-- the query_id=7 seem to come from just 1 pid,
-- pg_stat and ps -ef show that pid to be the pg_cron launcher (in my case)
select pid which_pid, count (*) nr_sevens
from yb_active_session_history
where query_id = 7 
group by pid; 


-- which app is doing the sevens
select pid, application_name 
from pg_stat_activity 
where pid in  ( select pid 
                 from yb_active_session_history 
                where query_id = 7 
              );

-- mostly "Extension", occasionally also other waits.. 
select ash.wait_event, ash.wait_event_class , ash.wait_event_type
, count (*)
--, ash.*
from yb_active_session_history  ash
where ash.query_id = 7 
group by 1, 2, 3;
order by ash.sample_time desc;


-- occuring one every second, e.g. every sample of ash?
select to_char ( ash.sample_time, 'HH24:MI:SS' ) as the_secnd, ash.pid, ash.sample_time, ash.wait_event
--, ash.* 
from yb_active_session_history ash
where ash.query_id = 7 
order by sample_time;

-- the same pid (cron?) Does seem to do Other queries a well,
-- notably query_id=5
select to_char ( ash.sample_time, 'HH24:MI:SS' ) as the_second
, ash.pid, ash.query_id, ash.wait_event
--, ash.* 
from yb_active_session_history ash
where ash.pid  in  ( select pid   -- any pid that has ever done a 7
                 from yb_active_session_history 
                where query_id = 7 
              )
  and ash.query_id != 7           -- but only show the non-7 records
order by sample_time desc ;


ASH: description of special query_id in a view yb_query_desc 

In the view yb_active_session_history there is specific set of query_ids that describe yb-activity.
The meaning of which I found here:
https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/observability/active-session-history/#constant-query-identifiers

Since 15.2-YB-2.25.0.0-b0, I found there are also id=0 and id-7 (coming from cron-extension"?).

Suggetion is to include a view with the descriptions of those queries:

A View to identify special values for query_id in ASH

The ASH view contains special values to identify yugabyte-specific activity, notably values 0..7.

note: I have not (yet?) spotted those values in pg_stat_acivity or pg_stat_statements

The translation of those values can currently (Jan-2025) be found here..
https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/observability/active-session-history/#constant-query-identifiers

Suggeston is to put those in a table or view for lookup or reference inside ybdb.
Similar to yb_wait_event_desc

My current solution is :



Hello Yugas,
The view yb_active_session_history has some good info in it, but I miss a usesysid. 
Is there a way to trace the ASH records to a specific user (usesysid) ? 

From an ASH records I can detect the pid and the tserver (top_level_node_id) and thus I can more or less "find the origin" of the activity. 
The yb_ASH view already holds the datid to point to the dqtabase (which I think is also pid-dependent), but it doesnt hold data that points to the "user" or to the "app name" of the session that is causing the ash_record. 

If (big IF) the pid is found (sampled) from pg_stat_activity, I can then determine usesysid and app, and all the info in the pg_stat_activity (e.g. the session-info). But if the session is short-lived, or if my sampling interval of pg_stat_activity is too long, I miss that information. 

-- more -- 

I can see several, overlapping, solutions to complete this data:
1) Iinclude a usesysid in the ash-record (it would be dependent on pid, IMHO). This would mean the usesysid (like other client info) travels down with the root_request and is visible (and kept) in all the nodes that participate in the processing of the root_request. Usefull when aggregating ASH records, but it does mean "keeping that info everywhere".
2) Provide a root_request record, as per earlier suggestion, and use it to hold the usesys, and datid, and query_id(s), and possibly more client-data. (github 25531)
3) Provide (create, generate) a "session" record, (yb_session ?) with some of the information from pg_stat_activity. A record that remains after the session is disconnected (whereas pg_stat_activity dissapears). This yb_session view should remains at least long enough to get found/polled/sampled/stored by whatever mechanism we use to investigate ASH and Session information. Very similar to yb_active_session_history.

Note that in my current "polling mechanism", I capture ASH data and pg_stat_activity data, and I can relate those data to generate a "profile" or a primitive "history" of a session.

And as inpiratin, this is what I considered as "session-info", called is session-master bcse the info should not change over the lifetime of the connection. 

I will also consider storing one or more "session_log" records: a complete copy of the latest pg_stat_activity, as a more complete collection of the "work-done" by the session.
