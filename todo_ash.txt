1. Query : find query-details from ash:
  - which root_id, list in order of time (last 1hr)
  - longest root_id (min/max)
  - session, app-name if know..

2. RR: find details on a root-req:
    - which app + where + when
    - how long was session..
    - which queries in the rr (in order of sample-time, with duration)
    - sequentially: the ash-recs (how to display per nodes...)

3. relate queries to tab/indx and tab/ind to queries..


start with:
 - extract root requests: 
    rr_uuid, start/end, session: sess_id => tsrv +pid+start_dt 
    - disintct rr + min/max.
    - then find session where min-rr is inside sess start/end 
 - extract combis of rr + query (with start_dt + end dt + ... ? )
 - based on qury: list RRs  (in given time-frame, say last hr)
    - duration of RR
    - duration of query(s) in RR
    - activity inside RR
    - activity in side Qry-in-RR
